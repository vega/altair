Altair Ecosystem
================

This is a list of projects related to or built on top of Altair. We hope to make it easier to find these projects by listing them here. If you know of a project that should be added, please let us know.

altair_recipes_
---------------

altair-recipes provides a collection of ready-made statistical graphics for vega. See the `docs <https://altair-recipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

gpdvega_
--------

gpdvega is a bridge between GeoPandas_, a geospatial extension of Pandas_, and Altair which allows to seamlessly chart geospatial data using altair. See the `docs <https://iliatimofeev.github.io/gpdvega/>`__.

nx_altair_
----------

nx_altair is a library for drawing NetworkX_ graphs using Altair. It offers a similar draw API as NetworkX but returns Altair Charts instead. This allows users to apply Altair's rich interactive API to networks graphs. See the `docs <https://Zsailer.readthedocs.io/nx_altair/>`__.

pdvega_
-------

pdvega is a library that allows you to quickly create interactive Vega-Lite_ plots from Pandas_ dataframes, using an API that is nearly identical to Pandas' built-in visualization tools, and designed for easy use within the Jupyter_ notebook. See the `docs <https://jakevdp.github.io/pdvega/>`__.

`Altair in R`_
--------------
Altair in R provides an R interface to the Altair Python package. See the `docs <https://vegawidget.github.io/altair/>`__.

.. List of links.
.. _`Altair in R`: https://github.com/vegawidget/altair

starborn_
---------

Starborn is a Python visualization library based on Vega and Altair that aims to be API-compatible with Seaborn_. Like Seaborn, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. Thanks to the underlying libraries, it can also offer interactivity with in-browser panning and zooming. See the `docs <https://github.com/PythonCharmers/starborn/blob/master/doc/starborn_examples.ipynb>`__.
