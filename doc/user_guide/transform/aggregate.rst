Aggregate
~~~~~~~~~
There are two ways to aggregate data within Altair: within the encoding itself,
or using a top level aggregate transform.

The aggregate property of a field definition can be used to compute aggregate
summary statistics (e.g., :code:`median`, :code:`min`, :code:`max`) over groups of data.

If any field in the specified encoding channels contains an aggregate,
the resulting visualization will show aggregate data. In this case, all
fields without a specified aggregation function are treated as group-by fields
in the aggregation process.

For example, the following bar chart aggregates mean of ``acceleration``,
grouped by the number of Cylinders.

.. altair-plot::

    import altair as alt
    from vega_datasets import data

    cars = data.cars.url

    alt.Chart(cars).mark_bar().encode(
        y='Cylinders:O',
        x='mean(Acceleration):Q',
    )

The Altair shorthand string::

    # ...
    x='mean(Acceleration):Q',
    # ...

is made available for convenience, and is equivalent to the longer form::

    # ...
    x=alt.X(field='Acceleration', aggregate='mean', type='quantitative'),
    # ...

For more information on shorthand encodings specifications, see
:ref:`shorthand-description`.

The same plot can be shown via an explicitly computed aggregation, using the
:meth:`~Chart.transform_aggregate` method:

.. altair-plot::

    alt.Chart(cars).mark_bar().encode(
        y='Cylinders:O',
        x='mean_acc:Q'
    ).transform_aggregate(
        mean_acc='mean(Acceleration)',
        groupby=["Cylinders"]
    )

The alternative to using aggregate functions is to preprocess the data with
Pandas, and then plot the resulting DataFrame:

.. altair-plot::

   cars_df = data.cars()
   source = (
      cars_df.groupby('Cylinders')
      .Acceleration
      .mean()
      .reset_index()
      .rename(columns={'Acceleration': 'mean_acc'})
   )

   alt.Chart(source).mark_bar().encode(
      y='Cylinders:O',
      x='mean_acc:Q'
   )

.. note::
   Altair transforms are great for quick exploration, while upfront analysis using
   dedicated dataframe libraries can be faster for large datasets. See :doc:`../data_transformers` for details.

Because :code:`Cylinders` is of type :code:`int64` in the :code:`source`
DataFrame, Altair would have treated it as a :code:`qualitative` --instead of
:code:`ordinal`-- type, had we not specified it. Making the type of data
explicit is important since it affects the resulting plot; see
:ref:`type-legend-scale` and :ref:`type-axis-scale` for two illustrated
examples. As a rule of thumb, it is better to make the data type explicit,
instead of relying on an implicit type conversion.

Functions Without Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Aggregate functions can be used without arguments. 
In such cases, the function operates directly on the input objects 
and returns the same value regardless of the provided field.

The following chart demonstrates this by counting the number of cars with
respect to their country of origin.

.. altair-plot::

   alt.Chart(cars).mark_bar().encode(
      y='Origin:N',
      # shorthand form of alt.X(aggregate='count')
      x='count()'
   )

.. note::
   The :code:`count` aggregate function is of type :code:`quantitative` by default,
   it does not matter if the source data is a DataFrame, URL pointer, CSV file or JSON file.

Functions that handle categorical data (such as :code:`count`,
:code:`missing`, :code:`distinct` and :code:`valid`) are the ones that get
the most out of this feature.

Argmin and Argmax Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :code:`argmin` and :code:`argmax` functions help you find values from
one field that correspond to the minimum or maximum values in another
field. For example, you might want to find the production budget of
movies that earned the highest gross revenue in each genre.

These functions must be used with the :meth:`~Chart.transform_aggregate`
method rather than their shorthand notations. They return objects that act
as selectors for values in other columns, rather than returning values
directly. You can think of the returned object as a dictionary where the
column serves as a key to retrieve corresponding values.


To illustrate this, let's compare the weights of cars with the highest
horsepower across different regions of origin:

.. altair-plot::

   alt.Chart(cars).mark_bar().encode(
      x='greatest_hp[Weight_in_lbs]:Q',
      y='Origin:N'
   ).transform_aggregate(
      greatest_hp='argmax(Horsepower)',
      groupby=['Origin']
   )

This visualization reveals an interesting contrast: among cars with the
highest horsepower in their respective regions, Japanese cars are notably
lighter, while American cars are substantially heavier.

See :ref:`gallery_line_chart_with_custom_legend` for another example that uses
:code:`argmax`. The case of :code:`argmin` is completely similar.

Transform Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :meth:`~Chart.transform_aggregate` method is built on the :class:`~AggregateTransform`
class, which has the following options:

.. altair-object-table:: altair.AggregateTransform

The :class:`~AggregatedFieldDef` objects have the following options:

.. altair-object-table:: altair.AggregatedFieldDef

.. _agg-func-table:

List of Aggregation Functions

In addition to ``count`` and ``average``, there are a large number of available
aggregation functions built into Altair; they are listed in the following table:
