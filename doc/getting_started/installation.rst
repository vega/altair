Installation
============

Altair can be installed, along with all its optional dependencies, using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install "altair[all]"

If you are using the conda_ package manager, the equivalent is:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge altair-all

At this point, you should be able to open any IDE compatible with Jupyter Notebooks,
and execute any of the code from the :ref:`example-gallery`.
For more information on how to display charts in various notebook environments
and non-notebook IDEs, see :ref:`displaying-charts`.
If you wish to install Altair with only the required dependencies,
you can omit the ``[all]``/``-all`` suffix.

Altair can also be installed with just the dependencies necessary for saving charts to offline HTML files or PNG/SVG/PDF formats, using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install "altair[save]"
