Basic Statistical Visualization
===================================

(This tutorial is adapted from `Vega-Lite's documentation
<http://vega.github.io/vega-lite/tutorials/getting_started.html>`_)

.. currentmodule:: altair

This tutorial will guide you through the basic process of creating
visualizations in Altair. First, you will need to make sure you have the Altair
package and its dependencies installed (see :ref:`installation`).
This tutorial will assume you are working within a Jupyter notebook user
interface (such as JupyterLab, Colab or VS Code), so that plots are automatically rendered. 
If you are using another interface, you may want to read about how Altair 
plots are displayed before proceeding (see :ref:`displaying-charts`).

Here is the outline of this basic tutorial:

- :ref:`basic-tutorial-data`
- :ref:`basic-tutorial-encodings-and-marks`
- :ref:`basic-tutorial-aggregation`
- :ref:`basic-tutorial-customization`
- :ref:`basic-tutorial-publishing`

.. _basic-tutorial-data:

The Data
--------

Data in Altair is built around the pandas Dataframe. One of the defining
characteristics of statistical visualization is that it begins with
`tidy <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html>`_
Dataframes. For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll start by importing pandas
and creating a simple DataFrame to visualize, with a categorical variable in
column a and a numerical variable in column b:

.. altair-plot::
   :output: none

   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.DataFrame({'a': list('CCCDDDEEE'),
                        'b': [2, 7, 4, 1, 2, 6, 8, 4, 7]})


When using Altair, datasets are most commonly provided as a Dataframe.
As we will see, the labeled columns of the dataframe are an essential
piece of plotting with Altair.

.. _basic-tutorial-chart-object:

The Chart Object
----------------

The fundamental object in Altair is the :class:`Chart`, which takes a
dataframe as a single argument:

.. altair-plot::
    :output: none

    import altair as alt
    chart = alt.Chart(data)

So far, we have defined the Chart object, but we have not yet told the chart
to *do* anything with the data. That will come next.

.. _basic-tutorial-encodings-and-marks:

Encodings and Marks
-------------------

With this chart object in hand, we can now specify how we would like the
data to be visualized. This is done via the ``mark`` attribute of the chart
object, which is most conveniently accessed via the ``Chart.mark_*`` methods.
For example, we can show the data as a point using :meth:`~Chart.mark_point`:


.. altair-plot::

    alt.Chart(data).mark_point()

Here the rendering consists of one point per row in the dataset, all plotted
on top of each other, since we have not yet specified positions for these
points.

To visually separate the points, we can map various *encoding channels*, or
*channels* for short, to columns in the dataset.
For example, we could *encode* the variable ``a`` of the data with the
``x`` channel, which represents the x-axis position of the points.
This can be done straightforwardly via the :meth:`Chart.encode` method:

.. altair-plot::

    alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
        x='a',
    )

The ``encode()`` method builds a key-value mapping between encoding channels
(such as ``x``, ``y``, ``color``, ``shape``, ``size``, etc.) to columns in
the dataset, accessed by column name.

For pandas dataframes, Altair automatically determines the appropriate data
type for the mapped column, which in this case is a *nominal* value, or an
unordered categorical.

Though we've now separated the data by one attribute, we still have multiple
points overlapping within each category. Let's further separate these by
adding a ``y`` encoding channel, mapped to the ``"b"`` column:

.. altair-plot::

    alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
        x='a',
        y='b'
    )

The type of the data in the ``"b"`` column is again automatically-inferred
by Altair, and this time is treated as a *quantitative* type (i.e. real-valued).
Additionally, we see that grid lines and appropriate axis titles are
automatically added as well.

.. _basic-tutorial-aggregation:

Data Transformation: Aggregation
--------------------------------

To allow for more flexibility in how data are visualized, Altair has a built-in
syntax for *aggregation* of data.
For example, we can compute the average of all values by specifying this
aggregate within the column identifier:

.. altair-plot::

    alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
        x='a',
        y='average(b)'
    )

Now within each x-axis category, we see a single point reflecting the
average of the values within that category.

Typically, aggregated values are not represented by point markings,
but by bar markings. We can do this by replacing :meth:`~Chart.mark_point`
with :meth:`~Chart.mark_bar`:

.. altair-plot::

    alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
        x='a',
        y='average(b)'
    )

Because the categorical feature is mapped to the ``x``-axis, the result is
a vertical bar chart. To get a horizontal bar chart, all we need is to
swap the ``x`` and ``y`` keywords:

.. altair-plot::

    alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
        y='a',
        x='average(b)'
    )

Aside: Examining the JSON Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recall that Altair's main purpose is to convert plot specifications to a JSON
string that conforms to the Vega-Lite schema.
It is instructive here to use the :meth:`~Chart.to_json` method to inspect the
JSON specification that Altair is exporting and sending as JSON to Vega-Lite:

.. altair-plot::
    :output: stdout

    chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
        x='a',
        y='average(b)',
    )
    print(chart.to_json())

Notice here that ``encode(x='a')`` has been expanded to a JSON structure with
a ``field`` name, and a ``type`` for the data.
The ``encode(y='b')`` has been expanded similarly and includes an ``aggregate``
field.

Altair's full shorthand syntax includes a way to specify the type of the
column as well:

.. altair-plot::
    :output: stdout

    y = alt.Y('average(b):Q')
    print(y.to_json())

This short-hand is equivalent to spelling-out the parameters by name:

.. altair-plot::
    :output: repr

    y = alt.Y(field='b', type='quantitative', aggregate='average')
    print(y.to_json())

This more verbose means of specifying channels can be used directly in
Altair chart specifications, a fact that becomes useful when using some
of the more advanced field configurations:

.. altair-plot::

    alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
        alt.Y('a', type='nominal'),
        alt.X('b', type='quantitative', aggregate='average')
    )


.. _basic-tutorial-customization:

Customizing your Visualization
------------------------------

By default, Altair via Vega-Lite makes some choices about default properties
of the visualization.
Altair also provides an API to customize the look of the visualization.
For example, we can specify the axis titles using the :meth:`title` method
of channel classes, and we can specify the color of the mark by setting
the ``color`` keyword of the ``Chart.mark_*`` method to any valid HTML
color string:

.. altair-plot::

    alt.Chart(data).mark_bar(color='firebrick').encode(
        alt.Y('a').title('category'),
        alt.X('average(b)').title('avg(b) by category')
    )


.. _basic-tutorial-publishing:

Publishing your Visualization
-----------------------------

Once you have visualized your data, perhaps you would like to publish it
somewhere on the web. This can be done straightforwardly using the
Vega-Embed_ Javascript package.
A simple example of a stand-alone HTML document can be generated for any
chart using the :meth:`Chart.save` method:

.. code-block:: python

    chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode(
        x='a',
        y='average(b)',
    )
    chart.save('chart.html')

The basic HTML template produces output that looks like this, where the JSON
specification for your plot produced by :meth:`Chart.to_json` should be stored
in the ``spec`` Javascript variable:

.. code-block:: html

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@3"></script>
      <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@2"></script>
      <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@3"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="vis"></div>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        var spec = {};  /* JSON dump of your chart's spec */
        var opt = {"renderer": "canvas", "actions": false};  /* Options for the embedding */
        vegaEmbed("#vis", spec, opt);
      </script>
    </body>
  </html>

The :meth:`~Chart.save` method provides a convenient way to save such HTML
output to file.
