Please follow these guidelines when submitting your PR:

- Describe the purpose of the changes in PR, so that it is easy to understand the implication of the suggested changes.
    - Here is a [helpful article about writing effective PR descriptions](https://medium.com/@greenberg/writing-pull-requests-your-coworkers-might-enjoy-reading-9d0307e93da3).
- Include unit tests and documentation for new features
- Ensure that the title is a concise [semantic commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g. "feat: Add `embed_options` to charts").
    - Append `!` if the change is breaking (e.g. "fix!: Raise error when `embed_options` is `None`")
