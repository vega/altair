        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
        
        Note that since Altair is a Python wrapper around the Vega-Lite visualization grammar, [most bugs should be reported directly to Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/issues). You can click the Action Button (`...`) of your Altair chart and "Open in Vega Editor" to see if you get the same error in the Vega Editor.
        
        If you can't reproduce the bug in the Vega Editor, then make sure you are using [the latest version of Altair](https://github.com/vega/altair/releases) and search for duplicate issues before filling out the form below.
