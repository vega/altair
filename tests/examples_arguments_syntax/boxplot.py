Boxplot with Min/Max Whiskers
------------------------------
This example shows how to make a boxplot using US Population data from 2000.  
Note that the default value of the `extent` property is 1.5,
which represents the convention of extending the whiskers
to the furthest points within 1.5 * IQR from the first and third quartile.
