        Dtype description as a tuple ``(kind, bit-width, format string, endianness)``.

        Bit-width : the number of bits as an integer
        Format string : data type description format string in Apache Arrow C
                        Data Interface format.
        Endianness : current only native endianness (``=``) is supported

        Notes:
            - Kind specifiers are aligned with DLPack where possible (hence the
              jump to 20, leave enough room for future extension)
            - Masks must be specified as boolean with either bit width 1 (for bit
              masks) or 8 (for byte masks).
            - Dtype width in bits was preferred over bytes
            - Endianness isn't too useful, but included now in case in the future
              we need to support non-native endianness
            - Went with Apache Arrow format strings over NumPy format strings
              because they're more complete from a dataframe perspective
            - Format strings are mostly useful for datetime specification, and
              for categoricals.
            - For categoricals, the format string describes the type of the
              categorical in the data buffer. In case of a separate encoding of
              the categorical (e.g. an integer to string mapping), this can
              be derived from ``self.describe_categorical``.
            - Data types not included: complex, Arrow-style null, binary, decimal,
              and nested (list, struct, map, union) dtypes.

                             category values (e.g. an array of cat1, cat2, ...).
                             None if not a dictionary-style categorical.

        ``nan_as_null`` is a keyword intended for the consumer to tell the

        It is intended for cases where the consumer does not support the bit
        mask or byte mask that is the producer's native representation.
        ``allow_copy`` is a keyword that defines whether or not the library is
        allowed to make a copy of the data. For example, copying data would be
        necessary if a library supports strided buffers, given that this protocol
        specifies contiguous buffers.
