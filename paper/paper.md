# Summary

Altair is a statistical visualization library for Python. Statistical visualization is a constrained subset of data visualization focused on the creation of visualizations
that are helpful in statistical modeling. The constrained model of statistical visualization is usually expressed in terms of a visualization grammar [] that specifies how input data is transformed and mapped to visual properties (position, color, size, etc.).

Altair is based on the Vega-Lite visualization grammar [], which allows a wide range of statistical
visualizations to be expressed using a small number of grammar primitives. Vega-Lite is declarative; visualizations are specified using JSON data that follows the Vega-Lite JSON schema.
As a Python library, Altair provides an API oriented towards scientists and data scientists
doing exploratory data analysis []. Altair's Python API emits Vega-Lite JSON data, which is then
rendered in a user-interface such as the Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab or nteract using the
Vega-Lite JavaScript library []. Vega-Lite JSON is compiled to a full Vega specification [], which is then parsed and executed using a reactive runtime that internally makes use of D3.js [].

The declarative nature of the Vega-Lite visualization grammar, and its encoding in a formal
JSON schema, provide Altair with a number of benefits. First, much of the Altair Python code,
tests, and examples are autogenerated from the Vega-Lite JSON schema, ensuring strict conformance
with the Vega-Lite specification. Second, the JSON data produced by Altair and consumed by Vega-Lite provides a natural serialization and file format for statistical visualizations. This is leveraged by JupyterLab, which provides built-in rendering of these files. Third, the JSON data 
provides a clean integration point for non-programming based visualization user-interfaces such as Voyager [].

In addition to static documentation [], Altair includes a set of Jupyter Notebooks with examples
and an interactive tutorial. These notebooks can be by anyone with only a web-browser through
binder [].
